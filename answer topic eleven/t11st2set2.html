	<p class="style4"><strong>Qn22.	Briefly describe any two types of computer networks</strong></p>
	<ul class="style5">
	  <li>
		A local area network (LAN) is a network that connects computers in a small geographic area such as a building like a computer laboratory, or an office
		</li>
	  <li> 
		A personal area network (PAN) is a LAN within the range of an individual person, typically interconnecting personal devices like phone, tablet, laptop, speakers, music player, etc.
		</li>
	  <li>
		A wireless LAN (WLAN) is a LAN that uses wireless technologies such as Wi-Fi so connect the computers.
		</li>
	  <li>
		A Campus Area Network (CAN) is a network that connects two or more LANs but is limited to a specific and contiguous geographical area such as a college campus, industrial complex, or a military base. It spans multiple LANs but smaller than a MAN
		</li>
	  <li>
		A metropolitan area network (MAN) is a large computer network that usually spans a city or a large campus.  
		</li>
	  <li>
		A wide Area Network (WAN) is a network that covers a large geographic area.
		</li>
	  <li>
		A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a public network, and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p class="style4"><strong>Qn23.	Difference between Intranet, Extranet and Internet</strong></p>
	<ul class="style5">
	  <li>Intranet refers to an inter connection of private computer networks within an organization;</li>
	  <li>Extranet is an extension of an intranet - used even outside the organization.</li>
	  <li>Internet is global.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="style4"><strong>Qn24.	Differentiate between client-server and peer-to-peer network models</strong></p>
	<p class="style5"><em>
		A client/server network has one or more computers acting as a server while the other computers (i.e., clients) on the network can request services from the server WHILE
		Peer-to-Peer Networks Involve the sharing of Information or resources between two or more computers connected to each other without the use of a Server
	</em></p>
		
	<p class="style4"><strong>Qn25.	Briefly explain the following types of servers</strong></p>
	<p class="style4"><strong>a.	A dedicated server</strong></p>
	<p class="style5"><em>
		A dedicated server is a server that performs a specific task.
	</em></p>
	<p class="style4"><strong>b.	A file server</strong></p>
	<p class="style5"><em>
		A file server stores and manages files on a network
	</em></p>
	<p class="style4"><strong>c.	A print server</strong></p>
	<p class="style5"><em>
		A print server manages printers and print jobs
	</em></p>
	<p class="style4"><strong>d.	A database server</strong></p>
	<p class="style5"><em>
		A database server stores and provides access to a database
	</em></p>
	<p class="style4"><strong>e.	A network server</strong></p>
	<p class="style5"><em>
		A network server (e.g., a DNS) manages network traffic
	</em></p>

	<p class="style4"><strong>Qn26.	State any five requirements of a server computer</strong></p>
	<ul class="style5">
	  <li>It needs a computer with very high processing speed </li>
	  <li>It needs large amounts of RAM </li>
	  <li>It needs a very big storage capacity </li>
	  <li>It needs a very fast Network interface card </li>
	  <li>It needs network operating system such as Novell Netware, Windows NT Server or Apple Share</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="style4"><strong>Qn27.	State any five advantages and disadvantages of client-server network model</strong></p>
	<p class="style4"><strong>Advantages of a Client/Server Network </strong></p>
	<ul class="style5">
		<li>All Resources are centralized and easier to access. </li>
		<li>Easy management and administration of the network. </li>
		<li>More data security since all network access is controlled through the server. </li>
		<li>The network is flexible, because changes and new technology can be easily included into system. </li>
		<li>Client /Server network is faster than P2P since data and resources are handled by a dedicated machine. </li>
		<li>It is easy to backup all data stored centrally on the server. </li>
		<li>Client Server network can support many computers as compared to a P2P network </li>
	</ul>
	<p class="style4"><strong>Disadvantages of a Client /Server Network </strong></p>
	<ul class="style5">
	  <li>It is expensive to set up as compared to a P2P network. </li>
	  <li>It requires an extra computer to serve as a dedicated server. </li>
	  <li>Maintenance – large networks will require an administrator staff to ensure efficient operation </li>
	  <li>Dependence – When the server goes down, operations will cease across the network </li>
	  <li>Server can get overloaded since all the processing is controlled at one point. </li>
	</ul>

	<p class="style4"><strong>Qn28.	State any five advantages and disadvantages of peer-to-peer</strong></p>
	<p class="style4"><strong>Advantages of Peer-to-Peer Network</strong></p>
	<ul class="style5">
	  <li>A peer-to-peer network is simple to setup i.e., does not require too much configuring.</li>
	  <li>It is not expensive to set up.</li>
	  <li>It does not require a dedicated server to control the network.</li>
	  <li>It is perfect for home and small business users.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="style4"><strong>Disadvantages of a Peer-to-Peer Network</strong></p>
	<ul class="style5">
	  <li>The system is not centralized, making administration difficult.</li>
	  <li>Limited security i.e., files can be accessed by any one on the network</li>
	</ul>
