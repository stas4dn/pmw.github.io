  <p class="style4">Qn48.	Define emerging technologies</p>
  <p class="style5">
    Emerging technologies are those that are currently being developed or will be developed in the next few years, and which will alter the business and social environment
  </p>
  
  <p class="style4">Qn49.	List some of the emerging technologies today</p>
  <ul class="style5">
    <li>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</li>
    <li>Digital forensics   		</li>
    <li>Biometrics			</li>
    <li>Robotics</li>
    <li>Quantum Cryptography 	</li>
    <li>Virtual Reality </li>
    <li>Computer Assisted Translation (CAT) </li>
    <li>3D and Holographic Imaging (aka holograms)</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="style4">Qn50.	Define the following as used in emerging technologies</p>
  <p class="style4">a.	Artificial intelligence</p>
  <p class="style5">
    This is a computer science that is focused on creating computer systems that simulate human intelligence
  </p>
  <p class="style4">b.	Digital forensics</p>
  <p class="style5">
    Digital forensics, also called computer forensics, network forensics, or cyberforensics, is the discovery, collection, and analysis of evidence found on computers and networks
  </p>
  <p class="style4">c.	Quantum cryptography</p>
  <p class="style5">
    Quantum cryptography (encryption) is an emerging technology that allows messages and data to be sent with complete privacy
  </p>
  <p class="style4">d.	Computer Assisted Translation</p>
  <p class="style5">
    CAT is where a human translator uses computer software to help in the translation process
  </p>
  <p class="style4">e.	Holograms</p>
  <p class="style5">
    This is a technique where images are made to appear three-dimensional and to actually have depth.
  </p>
  <p class="style4">f.	Virtual reality</p>
  <p class="style5">
    Virtual reality is where computers are used to create an artificial environment that users can interact with as if it were real.
  </p>

  <p class="style4">Qn51.	State any four areas where AI is applied today</p>
  <ul class="style5">
    <li>Expert Systems - These are computers that have been programmed to make decisions based on information they are given. For example: Medical expert systems can diagnose patient's illnesses based on symptoms entered. </li>
    <li>Languages - This type of AI involves computers that can understand different human languages as they are spoken to them. </li>
    <li>Robotics - Robotic artificial intelligence is where machines are programmed to imitate a human. </li>
    <li>Game Playing - Computers developed to play games against human players. For example: In 1997 a computer named 'Deep-Blue' defeated a world champion in the game of chess.</li>
  </ul>
    
  <p class="style4">Qn52.	Mention any four impacts of AI on everyday life</p>
  <ul class="style5">
    <li>Accurate prediction of weather - AI software will soon be used to sift through weather data more accurately that humans can and will be used to predict approaching storms and automatically issue warnings.</li>
    <li>Increased leisure time - Robotic vacuum cleaners are becoming more and more popular. These can detect walls and other objects in order to vacuum around them. People can leave them running whilst they enjoy extra spare time. </li>
    <li>Safer transport â€“ Self driving cars already exist will drastically reduce road accidents. Driverless trains too already exist in some countries!</li>
    <li>Increased Personal safety - Modern home alarm systems use artificial intelligence software that can tell the difference between the home owners and intruders. The software automatically alerts the police when intruders are detected. </li>
    <li>Improved medical care - Robotic surgery assistants are being used to quickly and accurately pass the correct surgical tools to doctors.  The few seconds saved in getting the correct tool to the doctor can save patient's lives.</li>
  </ul>
