<p class="style4">SubTopic 1:Booting process</p>
<p class="style4"><strong>Qn1.	Define the term booting</strong></p>
<p class="style5"><em>
Booting is the process of starting up/restarting a computer. OR <br/>
Booting (also known as booting up) is the initial set of operations that a computer system performs when electrical power is switched on. 
</em></p>
<p class="style4"><strong>Qn2.	Briefly explain the booting process</strong></p>
<ul class="style5">
	<li><em>The power supply sends a signal to the components in the system unit and the processor finds the ROM chip(s) that contain the BIOS </em></li>
	<li><em>The BIOS performs the POST which checks components such as the mouse, keyboard and adapter cards and the results of the POST are compared with data in a CMOS chip</em></li>
	<li><em>The BIOS looks for system files on the boot device.</em></li>
	<li><em>The system files and the kernel of the Operating System load into RAM from the boot device.</em></li>
	<li><em>The OS loads configuration information and displays the welcome screen.</em></li>
</ul>
<p class="style4"><strong>Qn3.	Distinguish between cold booting and warm booting</strong></p>
<p class="style5"><em>
Cold/Hard booting is the process of starting up a computer which has been completely off. Usually, it is initiated by switching on the power supply buttons on the monitor and system unit /box respectively WHILE <br/>
Warm/Soft Booting/rebooting is the process of restarting a computer which is already running. It is also called rebooting.
</em></p>
<p class="style4"><strong>Qn4.	State any five reasons for warm booting</strong></p>
<ul class="style5">
  <li><em>New software installations</em></li>
  <li><em>New hardware installations</em></li>
  <li><em>After Updating Software</em></li>
  <li><em>During Troubleshooting</em></li>
  <li><em>Switching operating systems</em></li>
  <li><em>When the computer is freezing</em></li>
  <li><em>When a peripheral or hardware component has failed to function/work</em></li>
  <li><em>When application software fails to work normally</em></li>
  <li><em>During/After installation of operating system.</em></li>
  <li><em>After changing use control settings(CMOS/BIOS settings)</em></li>
  <li><em>When a user wants to clear programs that are loaded in memory</em></li>
  <li><em>After uninstalling software</em></li>
  <li><em>After uninstalling hardware</em></li>
  <li><em>After malware/virus scanning </em></li>
  <li><em>When a deadlock occurs</em></li>
</ul>

<p class="style4"><strong>Qn5.	Define a computer program</strong></p>
<p class="style5"><em>
A computer program is a set of instructions that a computer uses to perform a specific task, such as word processing, accounting, or data management. Also called an application.
</em></p>

<p class="style4"><strong>Qn6.	State any five differences between a computer program and a computer software</strong></p>
